# Component - Modal

This is a modal component I developed for a custom CSS framework I co-created at White Lion Interactive.

## Functionality

The component consists of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (SCSS). At a minimum the component requires a trigger (a button or anchor element with `[data-modal-show="some-modal"]`) and a modal (an element with `[data-modal="some-modal"]`). The modal dialog is responsive and uses flexbox for positioning, so it may be easily centered, if desired.

_Note: This repo is for code review (read-only) purposes. The component relies on dependencies that are not not included in this project._
